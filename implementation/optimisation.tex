\subsection{Optimisation}

In order to track and analyse squats in real-time, the code needed to be optimised. This was particularly important after the port to Android, where the limited hardware of a mobile device made inefficiencies more apparent.

OpenCV provide a short set of guidelines for best practices in using their libraries on Android\cite{opencvoptim}. The main practices encouraged are to avoid repetitive Java Native Interface (JNI) calls into C++ code, and to avoid excessive memory allocations by initialising matrices towards the start of the application, reusing them rather than reallocating them upon every use.

Matrices in OpenCV are defined as \verb!Mat! objects. In order to follow the best practices for allocating and using \verb!Mat! objects, a \verb!MatManager! class was created. The \verb!MatManager! is a static class though which the codebase retrieves matrices. It has a single function, \verb!get()! which returns a reference to a \verb!Mat!. This \verb!get()! function takes a string key as a parameter, and keeps track of a map of these keys to \verb!Mat! objects. When requested for a matrix with a key that does not exist in the map, the matrix is created, and when the key does exist, the matrix that has previously been created is returned.

The \verb!MatManager! made it very simple to modify the code to reuse matrices. Wherever the codebase had previously created a \verb!Mat!, the construction was replaced with \verb!MatManager.get()! and an appropriate key.

The use of \verb!MatManager! dramatically increased the speed of the application on Android, allowing tracking and analysis to occur in real-time. It avoids the allocation of more memory than the application needs, and the overhead of garbage collection to clear the memory space of dereferenced matrices. Each allocation of a matrix also requires a JNI call, and so these were also minimised.
