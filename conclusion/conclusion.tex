\section{Conclusion}

The initial goal of the project was to produce a non-intrusive, accurate squat tracking application that could provide accurate feedback on squat technique in real-time. After an extensive evaluation of the application's performance, accuracy and usability it can be concluded that the application meets this goal.

The major accomplishments of this project have been:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A robust method of side-view body pose tracking using a monocular camera
	\item Pose analysis to determine the correctness and safety of squat form
	\item A real-time implementation on an Android device
	\item An intuitive and user-friendly application ready for release to the general public
\end{itemize}

It has been shown that real-time body pose tracking and analysis can be achieved on a mobile device with limited resources, using a monocular camera. This gives rise to a multitude of possibilities, not only in the analysis of weight lifting techniques but in many different fields. Some examples are mentioned in section~\ref{sec:future}.

The main result of this project has been an Android application that provides users with real-time feedback on their squat form, aiding them in their training. It allows users to improve their squat form and thus improve the safety and effectiveness of their exercise routine, providing them with better results at the gym and preserving the longevity of the muscular system.

Although the application has its disadvantages, such as finding a clear space to perform the lifts in a gym and its use of resources on an Android device, it has been found to be able to measure squat form accurately, providing the general public with a portable and effective training tool.
