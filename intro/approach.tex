\subsection{Approach}

The idea is to develop an application that can give feedback on a powerlifting technique, informing the user whether or not it was completed to competition standard, and giving feedback on whether the lift was executed as safely as possible. It should be portable and unintrusive, as an amateur lifter should be able to bring it to the gym and perform their lifts with no more equipment than they would usually use.
