\subsection{Weight Training}

Weight lifting is popular among those training for a particular sport, or as a form of recreation. While training programmes include many exercises, there are three lifts that are considered fundamental and are the basis of the majority of effective routines. These three lifts are the three powerlifting techniques.

Powerlifting is a sport where the objective is to lift the maximum possible weight in each of three movements. These movements are the squat, bench press and deadlift.

In a competition, powerlifters are given three attempts at each of the three lifts, and the weights of the maximum successful lift for each movement are summed to give the lifter's `total'. The total is their score in the competition, and the lifter with the highest score in their weight category is deemed the winner.

Whether training for powerlifting or other sports, the squat, bench press and deadlift are an integral part of training for any gym-goer. These three lifts are detailed below.
