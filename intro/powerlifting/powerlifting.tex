\subsection{Lifting Weights}

Whether training for a particular sport or as a form of recreation, many people lift weights at a gym. Training programs will often include many exercises, varying in difficulty and effectiveness. Among the fundamental lifts used in training, are the three powerlifting techniques.

Powerlifting is a sport similar to olympic weightlifting, where the objective is to lift the maximum weight possible in certain movements. These movements are the squat, bench press and deadlift.

In a competition, powerlifters are given three attempts at each of the three lifts, and the weights of the maximum successful lift for each movement are summed to give the lifter’s ‘total’. The ‘total’ is their score in the competition, and the lifter with the highest score in their weight category is deemed the winner.

Whether training for powerlifting or other applications, these three lifts are an integral part of training for any gym-goer.
