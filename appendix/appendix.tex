\section{Verbal Feedback}
\label{sec:appendix_feedback}

Verbal feedback is given according to the score brackets shown in figure~\ref{fig:score_brackets}:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
	\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | }
		\hline
	    \textbf{Score (\%)} & \textbf{Feedback}\\ \hline
	    [0,30) & Not very good \\ \hline
		[30,50) & Ok \\ \hline
		[50,70) & Good \\ \hline
		[70,90) & Very good \\ \hline
		[90,100) & Excellent \\ \hline
		100 & Perfect \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}

Tips are given when a problem is detected with a squat and the score is below 90\%. Figure~\ref{fig:tips} and \ref{fig:tips2} show the tips that can be given for each problem:

\section{Analysis Evaluation Scores}
\label{sec:analysis_eval_scores}

The following figures show the scores awarded by an expert observing the squat, against the score awarded by the application. Note that scores tracked incorrectly are marked, these are where the model did not correctly map to the figure throughout the duration of the lift.
