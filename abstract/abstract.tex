\section*{Abstract}

Squats are a very common exercise used both by athletes training for sporting events, and amateurs lifting weights recreationally. As a reasonably advanced compound movement, squats can often be performed incorrectly, leading to an ineffective training program and in some cases injury. This project offers a solution to this problem, an application called \emph{Squat!}. \emph{Squat!} is a real-time squat tracking and analysis application, which uses computer vision to examine a user's squat technique whilst they are performing the lift, offering immediate feedback. In this project, a non-intrusive marker-less algorithm to track and analyse a lifter's pose using a monocular camera has been developed, and implemented to run in real-time on an Android device. The result of this project is an intuitive and accurate application for use as a training aid, enabling users to improve the safety and effectiveness of their squats.
