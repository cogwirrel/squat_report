\section*{Abstract}

Squats are a common exercise used by both athletes in their training and amateurs lifting weights recreationally. As a reasonably advanced compound movement, squats can often be performed incorrectly, leading to an ineffective training programme and potentially serious injury. This project offers a solution to this problem- an application called \emph{Squat!}. \emph{Squat!} is a real-time squat tracking and analysis application, which employs computer vision to examine a user's squat technique whilst they are performing the lift, offering immediate feedback. In this project a non-intrusive, marker-less algorithm to track and analyse a lifter's pose using a monocular camera has been developed and implemented to run in real-time on a mobile device. The result of this project is an intuitive and accurate application for use as a training aid, enabling users to improve the safety and effectiveness of their squats.
