\chapter*{Abstract}

Squats are a common exercise used by both athletes in their training and amateurs lifting weights recreationally. As a reasonably advanced compound movement, squats can often be performed incorrectly, leading to an ineffective training programme and potentially serious injury.

This project offers a solution to this problem - a non-intrusive, marker-less algorithm developed to track and analyse a lifter's pose in real-time using a monocular camera. Implemented as an application for a mobile device, \emph{Squat!} employs computer vision to examine a user's squat technique whilst they are performing the lift, offering immediate feedback. The result of this project is an intuitive and accurate mobile application for use as a training aid, enabling users to improve the safety and effectiveness of their squats.
