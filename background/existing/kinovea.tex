\subsubsection{Kinovea}

Kinovea\cite{kinovea} describes itself as `a microscope for your videos'. It allows videos to be slowed down, studied and commented on, with sport enthusiasts in mind. A particularly useful feature of Kinovea is the ability to track key points in the video, allowing the measurement of angles over time. 

Applied to squatting, a user could accurately track joints throughout a lift, measuring the angles to check whether the squat was completed safely and correctly. This requires a large manual effort, and a level of expertise and understanding in what makes a safe and correct squat. It also lacks the ability to provide real-time feedback, as the user must input a video file, and then manually mark the points to track.
