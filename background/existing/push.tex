\subsection{Push}

Push\cite{push} is a piece of equipment yet to be released, designed to track and analyse movements at the gym. It is a specialised hardware device that is strapped to the lifter's arm, and promises to track metrics such as reps (the number of repetitions of an exercise), sets (the number of groups of reps), force, power, balance and speed.

Push sounds like an exciting product, providing real-time tracking of many metrics for a very wide selection of lifts. However, Push does not seem to provide any feedback on the technique of the lift, offering no indication as to whether it was performed correctly or safely.
