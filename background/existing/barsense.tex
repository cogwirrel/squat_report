\subsubsection{Barsense}

Barsense\cite{barsense} is an Android application designed to track weight lifting techniques. It was developed with Olympic weightlifting (a sport consisting of two lifts where the objective of both is for the lifter to raise the barbell above their head) in mind, measuring the velocity and bar path throughout a lift.

The general procedure in using this application is to film a lift from the side, which is then analysed by Barsense. The user must then indicate the barbell's location, and Barsense tracks the movement of the barbell, tracing its path and providing a graph of its vertical velocity.

Barsense requires a level of expertise and understanding of the lifts - it is a tool to help self-analysis, but offers no feedback on the correctness or safety of the lift itself. The lack of real-time feedback means that it is more difficult for the user to adjust their technique during training, making it harder to learn the correct technique.
