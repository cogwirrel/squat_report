\subsubsection{Barsense}

Barsense\cite{barsense} is an Android application designed to track weight lifting techniques. It was developed with Olympic weightlifting (a sport consisting of two lifts where the objective of both is for the lifter to raise the barbell above their head) particularly in mind, measuring the velocity and bar path throughout a lift.

The general procedure in using this application is to film a lift from the side, then provide this video to Barsense. The user then has to indicate where the barbell is in the video, and Barsense tracks the movement of the barbell, tracing the bar's path and providing a graph of the bar's vertical velocity.

Barsense requires a level of expertise and understanding of the lifts - it is a tool to help self-analysis, but offers no feedback on the correctness or safety of the lift itself. The lack of real-time feedback means that it is more difficult for the user to adjust their technique during training, and makes it harder to learn the correct technique.
