\subsubsection{Android}

Android\cite{android} is a mobile platform which makes up a large proportion of mobile users. It is easy to develop applications which interface with various components (such as the camera) of an Android device, using its Java\cite{java} API. It is also simple to release applications to the wide Android user base via Google Play\cite{googleplay}.

To accelerate the development process, I plan to initially develop the core functionality as a Java application on a Linux machine, and to port it to Android once complete. I will then focus on the user interface to create a well rounded application for use in the real world.
