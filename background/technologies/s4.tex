\subsubsection{Samsung Galaxy S4}

I have opted to use my personal Android smartphone for this project, the Samsung Galaxy S4\cite{s4}. This is a reasonably up to date model, featuring a 1.9 GHz Quad-Core Processor and both front and rear cameras. This smartphone should help this project to reach the goal of providing real-time feedback on a lift.
