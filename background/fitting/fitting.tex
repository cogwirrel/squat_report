\subsection{Fitting the Model to a Frame}

Once we have separated the lifter from their surroundings, we must fit the representative human model to the silhouette so that it accurately represents the current state of the lifter in each frame. This is an optimisation problem, we wish to find the set of values of the models degrees of freedom that best fit the current frame.

In this project I will develop a cost function that the optimisation will minimise. I will use existing libraries to minimise the value returned by the cost function. The cost function will return how well, given the models parameters, the model fits to the current frame.
