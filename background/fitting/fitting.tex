\subsection{Fitting the Model to a Frame}

Once we have separated the lifter from their surroundings, we must fit the representative human model to the silhouette so that it accurately represents the current state of the lifter in each frame. This is an optimisation problem - the set of values for the model's degrees of freedom that best fit the current frame must be found.

In this project a cost function will be developed that an optimisation algorithm will minimise. The cost function will return how well, given the models parameters, the model fits to the current frame. Existing implementations of optimisation algorithms will be used minimise the value returned by the cost function.
