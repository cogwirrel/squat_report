\subsection{Fitting the Model to a Frame}

Once we have separated the lifter from their surroundings, we must fit the representative human model to the silhouette so that it accurately represents the current state of the lifter in each frame. This is an optimisation problem, we wish to find the set of values of the models degrees of freedom that best fit the current frame.

In this project a cost function will be developed that the optimisation algorithm will minimise. Existing implementations of optimisation algorithms will be used minimise the value returned by the cost function. The cost function will return how well, given the models parameters, the model fits to the current frame.
