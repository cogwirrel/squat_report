\subsubsection{Apache Commons Math Library}

I will use the Apache Commons Math Library\cite{apachemath} to perform optimisation of a cost function. This library has a suite of optimisation algorithms built-in, which can either minimise or maximise a user defined cost function. It is a widely used Java library, and is an apt choice due to its wide range of algorithms and simple API, enabling the optimisation algorithm to be quickly changed without a need to modify the cost function.
