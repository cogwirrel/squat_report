\subsubsection{Applied to this Project}

In practice background subtraction algorithms are more accurate given a stationary camera. Although algorithms for moving cameras do give reasonable results, they are less robust and require more computation.

Because of this, in this project I have opted to use a stationary camera, perhaps visiting the possibility of a moving camera as an extension. As a lifter will either train alone or with a partner `spotting' them, it is reasonable to assume that the lifter will wish to mount their mobile phone in a stationary position, rather than have a partner hold the device to film them.
