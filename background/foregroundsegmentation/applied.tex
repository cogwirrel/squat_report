\subsubsection{Applied to this Project}

In practice background subtraction algorithms are more accurate given a stationary camera. Although algorithms for moving cameras do give reasonable results, they are less robust and require more computation.

Because of this, in this project it has been decided to use a stationary camera. As a lifter will either train alone or with a partner `spotting' them, it is reasonable to assume that the lifter will wish to mount their mobile phone in a stationary position, rather than have a partner hold the device to film them.
