\subsection{Applied to this Project}

Unfortunately, despite the wide array of tools and libraries available for skeletal tracking with a three-dimensional sensor or stereo camera, it would be impractical to take a device such as a Kinect into a gym. Perhaps if the goal were to have the system set up at powerlifting competitions, or pre-installed at gyms, this method would be more reasonable. However as a personal training aid, the device must be portable.

Another alternative option would be to develop an application for a smartphone with a stereo camera. Smartphones such as the LG Optimus 3D\cite{lgoptimus} provide such a camera. However these phones are not currently in wide use and would severely limit the audience for this application.

For these reasons it has been chosen to employ a monocular approach. This will make foreground segmentation more challenging and so it has been decided to narrow the scope of the project to a known camera angle.
