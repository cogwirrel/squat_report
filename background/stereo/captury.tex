\subsubsection{Captury}

A company known as Captury\cite{captury} have constructed a method for robust motion capture using a stereo camera. In their paper `On-set Performance Capture of Multiple Actors With A Stereo Camera'\cite{capturystereopaper} they describe a method that ``employs appearance cues, scene flow, pose reconstruction results from previous frames, and stereo coherence to reliably segment out actors in front of general backgrounds.''. This method has been shown to be highly robust, and Captury have provided a video\cite{capturyvideo} to demonstrate this. Not only does their method track the skeleton, it also performs a further step to map a full three dimensional body to the video, for full motion capture.

Although immensely accurate, Captury's process requires a large amount of computation, in the order of minutes per frame. This means that use of an algorithm following their pipeline would not be able to achieve real-time feedback.
