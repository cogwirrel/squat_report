\section{The Algorithm}

In this section I will describe the algorithm that I have developed to solve the problem of real-time squat tracking and analysis. It consists of two main phases - detection and tracking. The detection phase provides automated initialisation, and the tracking phase analyses the squatting motion until the termination condition is established.
