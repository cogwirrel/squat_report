\section{The Algorithm}

In this section the algorithm developed to solve the problem of real-time squat tracking and analysis will be described. 

The algorithm consists of two main phases - detection and tracking. The detection phase provides automated initialisation, and the tracking phase analyses the squatting motion until the termination condition (detailed in section~\ref{sec:algorithm_overview}) is established.
