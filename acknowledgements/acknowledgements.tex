\section*{Acknowledgements}

Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Andrew Davison, for supporting me throughout this project. His feedback, advice and suggestions were all incredibly helpful in developing the algorithm and keeping to schedule.

I would also like to thank Professor Duncan Gillies, my second marker, for his support during the initial stages of the project.

Thank you to Tom Wilding, Greg Pye and Harry Stevenson for testing the application in the evaluation stage of the project, and offering feedback and ideas to improve the application.
