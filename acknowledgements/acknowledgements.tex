\section*{Acknowledgements}

Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Andrew Davison, for his feedback, advice and suggestions, which were helpful in developing the algorithm and keeping to schedule.

I would also like to thank Professor Duncan Gillies, my second marker, for his support during the initial stages of the project.

Thank you to Greg Pye, Harry Stevenson and Tom Wilding for testing the application in the evaluation stage of the project, and offering feedback and ideas to improve it.
